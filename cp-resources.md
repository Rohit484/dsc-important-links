> **Guideline:**
Make account on **a2oj** with the same username as on **codeforces**.
Join Ladders. If you are a beginner, start with Ladder A.

> InterviewBit and LeetCode are best resource for 3rd year students, as mentioned in the last session.

>Meanwhile, programmers using **C** should shift to **C++**. Those, who are using **Java**, should keep using it. **Python** programmers can shift to either of the options. But in my opinion, you should go with **C++**
